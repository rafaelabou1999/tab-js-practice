            <h2>Bill Gates</h2>
            <h4>(1955-today)</h4>

            <p>
              Bill Gates is an American entrepreneur, software developer,
              investor, and philanthropist. He co-founded Microsoft Corporation,
              the world's largest software company, with Paul Allen in 1975.
              Gates led the company to become one of the most successful tech
              companies in history before retiring in 2008. He is known for his
              philanthropic donations through the Bill and Melinda Gates
              Foundation, which focuses on reducing global poverty and improving
              healthcare. Gates is also recognized as one of the wealthiest
              people in the world, with a net worth of over $130 billion as of
              2021.

            <h2>Charles Babbage, The father of the Computer</h2>
            <h4>(1791-1871)</h4>
            <p>
              Charles Babbage, often referred to as the "father of the
              computer," was a prominent English mathematician, philosopher, and
              inventor. Born on December 26, 1791, Babbage is best known for his
              contributions to the field of computing and his design of the
              Analytical Engine. Babbage's fascination with machines and
              mathematics led him to envision a mechanical device that could
              perform complex calculations automatically. In 1822, he proposed
              the concept of a Difference Engine - a machine designed to
              calculate polynomial functions. Although never fully completed
              during his lifetime due to funding issues, Babbage's ideas laid
              the foundation for modern computers.

            <h2>Steve Jobs</h2>
            <h4>(1955-2011)</h4>
            <p>
              Steve Jobs, widely recognized as a visionary and innovator, was
              the co-founder of Apple Inc. and played a pivotal role in
              revolutionizing the technology industry. With his charismatic
              personality and relentless pursuit of perfection, Jobs left an
              indelible mark on the world. Born on February 24, 1955, in San
              Francisco, California, Jobs grew up with a passion for electronics
              and computers. In 1976, he co-founded Apple alongside Steve
              Wozniak in his parents' garage. Together, they developed the Apple
              I computer - a milestone that marked the beginning of their
              extraordinary journey. Under Jobs' leadership as CEO from 1997 to
              2011 (with a brief hiatus), Apple transformed into one of the most
              valuable and influential companies globally. His ability to
              envision groundbreaking products such as the Macintosh computer,
              iPod, iPhone, and iPad propelled Apple to unprecedented success.

            <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
            <h4>(1815-1852)</h4>
            <p>
              Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was a British mathematician and writer,
              known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical
              general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Lovelace is
              credited with writing the first algorithm intended to be processed
              by a machine, and thus is considered to be the world's first
              computer programmer. She also recognized the potential for
              computers to go beyond simple calculation and be used for more
              complex tasks, such as creating music and art. Lovelace's
              contributions to computing have earned her recognition as a
              pioneer in the field, and she is celebrated each year on Ada
              Lovelace Day, an international celebration of women in science,
              technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) fields.

            <h2>Alan Turing</h2>
            <h4>(1912-1954)</h4>
            <p>
              Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, and computer
              scientist. He is widely considered to be the father of modern
              computing and artificial intelligence. During World War II, he
              worked for the British government's code-breaking operation at
              Bletchley Park, where he made significant contributions to
              cracking the Nazi Enigma code. After the war, he continued to work
              in the field of computing, developing the first electronic
              computer in the UK. Tragically, Turing was convicted of
              homosexuality, which was illegal at the time, and forced to
              undergo chemical castration. He died by suicide in 1954 at the age
              of 41.

            <h2>John von Neumann</h2>
            <h4>(1903-1957)</h4>
            <p>
              John von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician who made
              groundbreaking contributions to a wide range of fields, including
              mathematics, physics, economics, and computer science. He is often
              credited with helping to invent the modern computer architecture
              and played a key role in the development of game theory. He also
              served as a consultant on various military projects, including the
              Manhattan Project, which led to the creation of the atomic bomb.
              Von Neumann was widely recognized as one of the most brilliant
              minds of the 20th century, and his work continues to influence
              scientific and technological advancements today. âˆ™ share
